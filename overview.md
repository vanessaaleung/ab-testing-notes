# Overview


## When can you use A/B testing?

Use A/B testing when you have clear <span style="text-decoration:underline;">control</span> and clear <span style="text-decoration:underline;">metrics</span>:



*   New ranking algorithm of movie recommendation 
*   Change in backend: page load time, results users see, etc.
*   Test layout of initial page

Donâ€™t use A/B testing when:



*   Is my site complete: ask the users instead
*   Test premium service: users need to subscribe to the service
*   Website selling cars: will take long to buy a car
*   Update brand & logo: is an emotional reaction
